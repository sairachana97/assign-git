1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
	The.gitignore file is a text file that instructs Git to ignore certain files or folders in a project.
    when we are generating a Java project we need .gitignore to look like this
	
   # Compiled class file
   *.class

   # Log file 
   *.log

   # BlueJ files
   *.ctxt

  # Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
  .mtj.tmp/

  # Package Files # 
  *.jar
  *.war
  *.nar
  *.ear
  *.zip
  *.tar.gz
  *.rar
 
•What does fast-forward in Git mean?
	When we try to merge a branch that is ahead of the one we checked out, we use fast-forward. 
For instance, suppose we're merging main and asnswer branch, but answer branch has advanced by a commit. 
We can fast-forward the main branch and it will point it to the same commit as answer branch.

•Why should you have different branches?
	Different branches can enable isolation, so that individual team members can work on different features. This also can ensure that main branch remains stable.

•In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	We can have as many Git repositories we need for the application but only one origin should be there, which is defaultly created by Git.
